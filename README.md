#ScoreKeeper

The icon came from a Google Search for "Score Keeper." It turned up an app with a [sweet icon](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Parth), so I'm using that.

##Thoughts

This was more enjoyable. I'm starting to get the hang of this iOS stuff. Still a lot of work and it's 12:15 now (I'm 15 minutes late). But I'm pretty sure I've satisfied all of the requirements which is more than I can say of all of my other submissions. I feel pretty good about my work here.
